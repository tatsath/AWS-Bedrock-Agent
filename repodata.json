I also find it difficult to find where to access the product when I first land on the landing page. \\nBrant: I would also add that I think there are too many steps. \\nNamita: Ok, I can work on the landing page to make the product more discoverable but brant can you work on the additonal forms? \\nBrant: Yes but I would need to work with James from another team as he needs to unblock the sign up workflow.  Miguel can you document any other concerns so that I can discuss with James only once? \\nMiguel: Sure. \\nFrom the meeting transcript above, Create a list of action items for each person. \\n \\n\",\"textGenerationConfig\":{\"maxTokenCount\":4096,\"stopSequences\":[\"User:\"],\"temperature\":0,\"topP\":1}}"
